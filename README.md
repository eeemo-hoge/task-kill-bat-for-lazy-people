# task-kill-bat-for-lazy-people
I just wanted to avoid awkward moment on zoom, discord etc. thus i wrote some simple kill bat files. 
actually just used AI and customized only for me. but, well, kinda, it will help for you, I'm glad.
And I added mouse setting because I hate to start that app every time when I lanch PC.
So so far, these kind of stuffs is in my startup files direction.
